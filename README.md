# üõ∞Ô∏è Autonomous AI-Driven Payload Drone

An intelligent, autonomous drone system designed for **disaster relief and rescue operations**. The drone detects humans from aerial footage, calculates optimal drop points, and autonomously delivers payloads using a YOLOv5-based computer vision model deployed on an edge device (Jetson Nano).

## üöÄ Overview

This project brings together real-time AI vision, hardware integration, and autonomous flight control. The system receives mission parameters via a FastAPI backend, processes live drone video on the Jetson Nano using a trained YOLOv5 model, and autonomously navigates to drop payloads near detected humans. Designed for use in post-disaster scenarios, it aims to deliver urgent aid with precision and intelligence.
